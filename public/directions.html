	<h2>Below are directions on how to use the LC Tech Forum:</h2>
	<div>
		<h3 style="margin-left:5px">Searching for a topic</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">If you are browsing or searching for a topic, a login is not required. To get more detail about a topic, click on the title of the topic in the left hand column of the table.  If the number of topics exceeds 25, you can get to more results by selecting a page number or the next or previous arrows that will appear above the table.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">If you want more specific results, add a word or phrase to the white bar at the top of the page and select the "Search" button or hit return. The application will return any topics that contain the search phrase in the title.</p>
	   <p>
		<h4 style="margin-left:10px">Tip on how to Search</h4>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">It is best to search by software name or task.  For instance, if you are looking for a topic that talks about using Photoshop to create a poster, the appropriate search would be "photoshop" <b>or</b> "create poster".  The former would return all topics that talk about Photoshop, and the former would return any topic having to do with poster creation.</p>
		<h3 style="margin-left:5px">Signing In</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">Sign in by selecting the "Sign in with Google" link on the top, right of the page.  If you are already signed into your gmail account, you will be prompted to allow the application access to your Google credentials.  (Don't worry the application only gathers the name and email associated with your Google account.) If you are not already signed in, the normal Google login page will pop up.  Enter your NCSU gmail id and password, and you will be prompted to allow the application access.  If you have multiple gmail accounts logged in, please select your NCSU gmail account. <b>(Note: You will only be prompted to allow access the first time you log into the application.)</b> Once you are logged in, you will see a message at the top of the screen that says you are "Signed in!", and you will see a message that you are "Logged in as [your name]" in the upper right of the page.</p> 
		<h3 style="margin-left:5px">Creating a new topic</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">Before creating a topic, search to see if the topic already exists in the forum</p>
		<h4 style="margin-left:10px">If the topic doesn't exist</h4>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">To create a topic, sign in and then click the "+ Add New Topic" button underneath the search bar.  Follow the directions below to fill out the form:</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px"><b>Title--The title of a topic should be the name of the software used and the task performed.</b> Imagine the patron wants a consultation for creating a website.  If they wanted information about using HTML and WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors, you might use Dreamweaver.  In this case, the title would be "Dreamweaver Create Website".  If the patron wanted to know about web content management systems/web creation tools, you might use WordPress or Google Sites.  In these cases, the title would be either, "Wordpress Create Website" or "Google Sites Create Website"."</p>

		<p style="margin-left:40px"><b>Web Resources Used--This field should contain links to any web resources used to help you solve the patrons problems.</b> Cut and paste the URL in the field.  Put a space before copy and pasting the second, third, etc. resource.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:40px"><b>Status--Select "open" or "closed" depending on whether the consultation was complete.</b> If you were able to help the patron solve all their problem(s), select "closed".  If there was any part of problem you could not help the patron fix, select the "open" option.</p>
		<h3 style="margin-left:5px">Creating a new comment</h3>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">If a topic already exists for a consultation you are about to perform, search and find that original post.  Click on the title of the consultation in the table to bring up the full record for it.  Click on the "Post a New Comment" button and follow the directions above for filling out the form.  <b>The title can remain the same as the post.</b>  Click the "Create Comment" button to submit the comment.</p>
				<h3 style="margin-left:5px">Show Comments</h3> 
		<p style="margin-left:20px">To view all comments on a post, select the "Show/Hide Thread" link on the bottom, left of the post.  Click the link again to hide the comments again.

If you use one of your peers' entries when preparing for a consultation, give it a thumbs up or down if it was helpful or not. This will <b>NOT</b> let your peers' see if you have given them a thumbs up or down.  Thought it will cause the more helpful topics to get pushed to the top of the comments thread; thus making it easier to find these topics.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:20px">Your posts will also be scored! If one of your posts or comments are given a thumbs up, 1 will be added to your score.  If one of your posts or comments are given a thumbs down, 1 will be subtracted to your score.The highest score at the end of semester may get a prize.  And the person with the worse score may be killed.  Who knows.</p>
